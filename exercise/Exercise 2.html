        <h1>Majical Cloudz Website Analysis</h1>
        <ol>
            <!--QUESTION 1-->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The fonts that used on website fits in with Majical Cloudz. After hearing two songs from them, the typeface match the artist- dark and deep.</p>
            <!--QUESTION 2-->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>Black and white, or dark. This represent Majical Cloudz very much as their music is slow and melanchony.</p>
            <!--QUESTION 3-->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>I feel like the visual are just there for random. It is just a random shots of the artist to give visual representation of them.</p>
            <!--QUESTION 4-->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>Very linear. I like the transition after the header, I thought that was neat. After that it is just straight down the long information and visuals.</p>
