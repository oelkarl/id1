            <!--QUESTION 1-->
        <h3>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</h3>
        <p>The size of the fonts is a little bigger which is good to me because the images on the background is too strong which compliments the size of the fonts. The pull quotes is amazingly well done, I like the window idea where some of the qoutes open like a window. </p>
            <!--QUESTION 2-->
        <h3>Describe the color palette. Where and how are specific colors used?</h3>
        <p>The color pallete is bright and the color choice compliments each other. The color were used to compliment to the background.</p>
            <!--QUESTION 3-->
        <h3>What role do the visuals play?</h3>
        <p>The role of the visual here is to express that this artist brings pleasure to the audience.</p>
            <!--QUESTION 4-->
        <h3>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy the subtle color change to black and white to colorful when you scroll down. The cues is when the color changes.</p>
