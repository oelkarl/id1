            <!--QUESTION 1-->
        <h3>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</h3>
        <p>I will start on the pull quotes because I enjoy the scribbles on the use of font. The header and paragraphs feels the opposite. The title is in all caps and smaller font than the body paragraph which to me do not mix very well. I did enjoy the scribbleness in the quotes, I hope the fonts in the body were somehow related.</p>
            <!--QUESTION 2-->
        <h3>Describe the color palette. Where and how are specific colors used?</h3>
        <p>The color palette is very joyful. You can see that the artist and the creator of this page is having fun. I think the colors were used to describe the artist that they are fun to listen to.</p>
            <!--QUESTION 3-->
        <h3>What role do the visuals play?</h3>
        <p>The visual feels so random. The layout feels childish, but the photos were mixed in terms of apperance. The artist both wears attires and pamjamas. I guess this shows that this artist can be serious or joyful in your taste.</p>
            <!--QUESTION 4-->
        <h3>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</h3>
        <p>The sections seperated is standard scroll down. The visual cues is so fun to watch, these scribble drawing in the background can be entertaining.</p>
