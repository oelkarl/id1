                    <ol>
                        <li>What adjective would you use to describe Bethany's portfolio?</li>
                        <p>Heck! Literally, thats the first thing I saw on Bethany's website. It's heck of a simple website that you need to know of Bethany.</p>
                        <li>Describe the design of the navigation.</li>
                        <p>Very direct navigation. It is very simple to follow through and easy to find what you need to look for. </p>
                        <li>Describe the design of the introductory information.</li>
                        <p>There are two introduction. One is about her accomplishment. Two is more about herself. I like the about me section. It is smaller size which pleasant to read, in my opinion.</p>
                        <li>Describe the design & layout of the body content.</li>
                        <p>Very squared. Everything you need to see is in front page, I guess thats enough to know the person. I think she may be going for first impression. You know like you are not suppose to judge a book by its cover, but her site is the opposite of that.</p>
                        <li>Describe the design of the footer.</li>
                        <p>I am not quite sure what to comment on the footer as I am having a hard time looking for the footer on her website. Please forgive me.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>How does the navigation change?</li>
                    <p>The navigation become linear as you navigate downwards. The simplenss remains which is good.</p>
                    <li>How does te size of the headline text change?</li>
                    <p>I see no changes, I guess everything have stayed the name regardless what window or browser you looking it on from.</p>
                    <li>How does the size of the body text change?</li>
                    <p>Here I feel like it became a little smaller. You can see the difference from the website to the phone. I guess it make sense to make it smaller since you are looking in on a smartphone.</p>
                    <li>How does the layout of the content change?</li>
                    <p>The layout became linear. Everything you have to scroll down to check more informations.</p>
                    <li>How does the layout of the footer change?</li>
                    <p>It became compress. Everything is centered and right next to each other.</p>
                </ol>

                        <li>What adjectives would you use to describe Olivia's portfolio?</li>
                        <p>First word that comes in my mind is fierce, then strong. Olivia's website shows that she is a strong designer and would take any job on her hands with no fear.</p>
                        <li>Describe the layout & design of the introductory section?</li>
                        <p>Very simple, I like the san serif font she used. I feel like from judging from her photos it matches her.</p>
                        <li>Describe the layout & design of the porfolio entries.</li>
                        <p>The layout is nicely placed. You can see her work as you scroll down. The design of her portfolio entries is the same.</p>
                        <li>Describe the layout & design of the footer.</li>
                        <p>The design of Olivia's footer is very direct and simple. No logos, just name and clicks.</p>

                        <li>How does the layout of the introductory section change?</li>
                        <p>I realize the photo have disappeared. The introductory is now just text of her introduction.</p>
                        <li>How does the layout of the portfolio entries change?</li>
                        <p>Nothing much have change except everything just lined up downwards which makes it a smartphone friendly website.</p>

                            <li>Describe the layout of the website.</li>
                            <p>Very minimal. I really like the typeface Danilo uses on his website.</p>
                            <li>Describe the design of website. How does Danilo indicate hierarchy?</li>
                            <p>The website is interactive. When you hover over the section, the background changes according to the subject you click. There is a small font size increase on headline and that's it.</p>
                            <li>How does the layout change?</li>
                            <p>The layout is super cool and interactive. The moment you click on one of his project, the website changed accordingly. It is very well made out. There is this fun factor on Danilo's website. I really enjoy looking on his website.</p>
                            <li>How does the size of the text change?</li>
                            <p>I believe the size of the text remain the same.</p>
