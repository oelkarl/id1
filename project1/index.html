        <h2><strong>Sponge Cola</strong></h2>
        <h4>Leo Karl Castro</h4>
        <p>Sponge Cola is my favorite musical artist. Sponge Cola is a local music band in the Philippines.  Sponge Cola is an alternative rock music. Many of Sponge Cola’s music is very deep emotional song. Their song is in Tagalog and English. How they get to were they are today. According to my research, Yael, lead vocal, and Gosh met in High school and decided to start a band from there. Sponge Cola was not Sponge Cola when Yael and Gosh started their band. Up until they change couple of their band member, it was named Sponge Cola. Originally, they name the band Sponge, but there was already a band name Sponge so they added Cola since it is an easy word to remember according to Yael.</p> 

        <p>To be honest, I did not know anything about Sponge Cola when I first listen to their music. I was young back then, all I care is their music is chill and made me smashed replay button. The first song I heard from Sponge Cola is called “Jeepney”. Jeepney is about someone in the past who used to see. Many of Sponge Cola’s music are slow, very deep emotional, or what you call ‘emo’ songs. So if you are in-love or heart broken, it is relatable. Sponge Cola’s first music is very iconic. Sponge Cola’s music is not only about love or feelings; they also have songs that can make you go feel hyped. Another reason I love Sponge Cola is I also play acoustic guitar. I just enjoy playing their music on my guitar since most of the tabs or notes are easy to hit. There are couple songs of Sponge Cola where they only use one guitar for the whole music which is very soothing in my ears since I really enjoy acoustic guitar tone.</p>

        <p>My favorite track of Sponge Cola would be Gemini or Dragonfly. Gemini track is based on Romeo and Juliet, not like I am a fan of Romeo and Juliet, but the track is so impactful. Also as if I can relate to the song since the track is about lovers. The song is written in three verse and it just repeat there but when you listen to it you get into emotion and get absorbed in the lyric. What I like about Dragonfly track is it relates me. The track talks about you who have feelings to someone that you have trouble expressing it out to someone. Because the dragonfly is basically me that somebody who cannot get the feeling in return, just right there hoping feelings will reach that person. There are many more tracks I like from Sponge Cola but I guess these two just came out first in my mind.</p>

        <p>Sponge Cola is very old rock band that still alive today and making albums. Even though today, the other bands that came before or the other bands that started in the same generation as them are disband right now. Sponge Cola has never changed their taste of music. They are still the Sponge Cola that knows how you feel, and they can relate to this generation too. I hope Sponge Cola will continue to make good music and would not disband any time soon because they have been making music for almost two decades. Sponge Cola rocks!</p>
