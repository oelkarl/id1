        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
            <p>In my essay, I express a very emotional feeling towards my artist. I wanted to express chill environment on my website. The artist I choosed composed many slow and chill songs. I want to show that on my website in my essay. Although I feel I let pictures over take the hierachy as I upload numbers of pictures. I feel like I failed to show what I want to show for my artist on my website. I also feel that there is a disconnect in my essay and to my wireframe.  </p>

        <h2>Moodboards</h2>
            <p>For my moodboard, I decided to show a more relax website for my artist. Many of the music my artist composed is very chill and relax. In my next project, I want to elaborate more and stick to the mood board as possible. Learn CSS so I can take control what I want to show on my next project. I believe a website is fun to read when it is very well made and easy to navigate and understand. </p>

        <h2>Project 1</h2>
            <p>At the very beginning it seem very easy to apply the code(html and css) on the website, but as I get far ahead, many things becoming complicated. There are things you want to happen this way but I can't do because the lack of experience or I don't know how to do it. What's most frustrating to me was trying to apply the code. There are some codes that are difficult to apply on your website.</p>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>For future, I want to look my website clean and easy to follow. I want to add things that would make audience stay in the beginning of my website. I don't like keeping the same from the previous, I like to try different and experience that I have level up from before.</p>
